# campus-eats
Team Reid, Minh, and Duy wanted to create an application that could be used on UTU school campus to provide gig work for fellow students that might be between classes. While we are very proud of the project we created, the school did not decide to participate in the project. 

This project was created when we were all still learning about MongoDB and Vuejs. We are proud of what we made, especially since we only worked on it for a couple of weeks. Hopefully someone else might have more support from their school when implementing this.
